Packages in Java serve several key purposes. We will discover shortly all of them here.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

First of all, Organization.

-------------------

They help in organizing classes into namespaces, making it easier to manage large projects with many classes. This prevents naming conflicts by encapsulating classes within a unique namespace.pa

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Access Control.

-------------------

Packages provide a way to control access to classes and their members. By default, classes in different packages do not have access to each other's package-private members (those with no access modifier), promoting encapsulation.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Reusability.

-------------------

Packages can be grouped into libraries or JAR files, making it easier to reuse code across different projects.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Naming Conventions.

-------------------

They help in avoiding name clashes by following a hierarchical naming convention, often reflecting the reverse domain name of the organization or project (e.g., com.example.myapp).

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Code Segregation.

-------------------

Different packages can represent different modules or components of an application, aiding in the separation of concerns.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Here's how you work with packages in Java.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Declaring a Package.

-------------------

At the very beginning of your Java source file (before any import statements), you declare the package for the class.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Importing Packages.

-------------------

To use classes from other packages, you use import statements.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Using Classes Without Import.

-------------------

If you don't want to use import statements, you can refer to classes by their fully qualified name.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Creating Subpackages.

-------------------

Packages can have subpackages, creating a hierarchy.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Accessing Classes in the Same Package.

-------------------

Classes within the same package can access each other's package-private (default access) members without needing import statements.

Here's an example demonstrating how classes within the same package can access each other's members without needing import statements, focusing on package-private (default) access:
Let's assume we have two classes, ClassA and ClassB, in the same package com.example.mypackage:

Both ClassA and ClassB are in the package com.example.mypackage.
ClassA has a method packagePrivateMethod() with no access modifier, making it package-private. This means it can be accessed by any class within com.example.mypackage but not from outside this package.
ClassB can call packagePrivateMethod() on an instance of ClassA because they are in the same package. No import statement is needed since they share the package.
The publicMethod() in ClassA is public, so it can be called from any class, regardless of the package.

When you compile and run ClassB, you'll see both methods being called because they're accessible within the same namespace.
This example illustrates how package-private access works within Java, providing a way to control visibility and organize code in a manner that's private to the package but shared among its classes.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Visibility in Packages.

-------------------

Each java method or class member can have one of the following modifiers:

public: Accessible from any other class in any package.
protected: Accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
No Modifier (default/package-private): Accessible only within its own package.
private: Only accessible within the class itself.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Best Practices.

-------------------

Use a unique package name, often starting with your domain name in reverse (e.g., com.example).
Keep related classes in the same package or in subpackages to maintain organization.
Avoid using wildcard imports in production code to explicitly show dependencies.

-------------------

Packages are integral to Java's design for managing code complexity and enhancing code organization, reusability, and security. Let's move on to the next topics.
