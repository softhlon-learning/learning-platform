Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll delve into the fundamentals of functional programming, particularly with insights into how these principles apply in Java. Let’s go through the six key aspects

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Pure Functions.

-------------------

Pure functions are the building blocks of functional programming. They're like mathematical functions: for given inputs, they'll always yield the same output without side effects. Consider this Java example:

This function add is pure because it doesn't modify any external state and always returns the same result for the same inputs. This predictability is central to functional programming, simplifying testing and maintaining code integrity.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Immutability.

-------------------

Immutability means once an object is created, its state cannot change. In Java, you've seen this with the final keyword, but since Java 8, we've had better support for immutable collections,

Immutable data structures prevent unintended side effects and make your code easier to reason about. If you need to modify data, you create a new object rather than altering the existing one.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

First-class and Higher-order Functions.

-------------------

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens - they can be passed around like any other data type. Java's lambda expressions and method references make this possible:

Here, map takes a function as an argument, demonstrating how we can pass behavior into methods, enhancing code modularity and readability.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Function Composition.

-------------------

This is about building complex functions from simpler ones. In Java, while we don't have a direct syntactic sugar for this, we can use method chaining or functional interfaces:

This complexOperation combines two simpler functions to create a new one, promoting code reuse and modularity.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Avoiding Shared State.

-------------------

Shared state can lead to bugs that are hard to track down due to concurrency issues or unexpected state changes. In functional programming, we aim to minimize this by using local variables and passing data explicitly:

By not relying on external state, we make functions stateless, thereby easier to parallelize and test.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Use of Recursion.

-------------------

Instead of loops, recursion can be used for repetitive tasks. Here’s a simple example of recursion for computing factorial in Java.

However, be cautious with recursion in Java due to stack overflow risks for large inputs.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, which are essentially anonymous functions. They allow us to write concise and readable code for functional interfaces.

-------------------

This code demonstrates the use of Java's Stream API for functional-style operations on a list (we'll cover details in next lectures).

-------------------

In summary, adopting these functional programming principles in Java can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code. It encourages us to think about problems in terms of transformations and data flows rather than sequence and state changes. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to discussing how we can apply these concepts in our next programming tasks.
