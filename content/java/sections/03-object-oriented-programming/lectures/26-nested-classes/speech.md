Hello everyone! Today, we’re diving into static nested classes in Java. These classes behave differently from other nested classes because of their static nature. Let’s get started!

-------------------
-------------------

A static nested class is declared with the static keyword inside another class. Unlike other nested classes, it doesn’t need an instance of the outer class to be instantiated. It’s like a standalone helper tied to the outer class’s namespace.

-------------------
-------------------

To use a static nested class, you instantiate it using the outer class name, like this. It’s perfect for utility classes or helpers that logically belong to the outer class but don’t need its instance data.

-------------------
-------------------

Consider a banking system. A Bank class might have a static nested CurrencyConverter class to handle conversions like USD to EUR. Since the converter doesn’t need a specific bank instance—just general conversion logic—it’s a great fit for a static nested class.

-------------------
-------------------

To conclude, static nested classes don’t rely on an outer class instance and are ideal for utilities tied to a class. Next time, we’ll explore inner classes, which behave quite differently!
