Welcome to our  lecture on anonymous classes! These are the rebels of nested classes—no name, just action. They’re defined and instantiated in one go, often for quick tasks like event handling. Today, we’ll unpack how they work and why they’re so popular. Let’s wrap up our series with this fascinating feature!

-------------------
-------------------

An anonymous class is a class that doesn’t have a name—it’s created right where it’s used. You define it and instantiate it in a single expression, usually to extend a class or implement an interface. It’s a shorthand approach for one-time use cases. Think of it as a throwaway class that gets the job done fast. Pretty cool, huh

-------------------
-------------------

Anonymous classes are everywhere in Java. They’re often used to implement interfaces or override methods on the fly, without needing a separate class definition. You’ll see them a lot in event listeners—like for button clicks in GUIs—where you just need a quick response. Their simplicity makes them a go-to for these scenarios. It’s all about convenience!

-------------------
-------------------

Here’s the syntax for an anonymous class. You start with something like an interface—Greeting here—and then use new followed by the implementation in braces. Inside, you define the methods, like sayHello(), which prints 'Hello!' when called. It’s all one expression, creating an object ready to use. This compact style is what makes anonymous classes stand out!

-------------------
-------------------

Using an anonymous class is as simple as calling its methods. After defining it, like in the previous slide, you just treat it like any object—here, greeting.sayHello() prints 'Hello!'. There’s no separate class file or name to worry about. It’s instant gratification for your coding needs. This ease is why developers love them!

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s try a real-life example: a game character system. We have a Character interface with an attack method, and we use an anonymous class to define a player who swings a sword. It’s a one-off behavior for that player—no need for a full class definition. When called, it outputs 'Player swings a sword!' This is ideal for quick customizations in games!

-------------------
-------------------

Anonymous classes have clear strengths. They’re concise and flexible, letting you whip up functionality fast. But they’re not reusable since they’re nameless, and they can get messy if the logic gets too complex. They’re best for short, simple tasks rather than big implementations. It’s about picking the right tool for the job!

-------------------
-------------------

That’s our tour of anonymous classes—and the end of our short series! We’ve covered static nested classes, inner classes, local classes, and now anonymous classes, each with its own flavor. I hope you feel confident using them in your Java projects.
