Welcome to our first lecture on Nested Classes in Java! Today, we’ll explore what nested classes are, why they exist, and how they can make your code more organized and efficient. Let’s dive in!

-------------------
-------------------

A nested class is simply a class defined within another class. Java supports two broad categories: static nested classes and non-static nested classes, which include inner classes, local classes, and anonymous classes. This structure allows better encapsulation and organization of related functionality. Think of it like a toolbox inside a bigger workshop.

-------------------

Why use nested classes? They help group related classes logically, hide implementation details through encapsulation, and make your code easier to read and maintain. For instance, if a class is only relevant to one outer class, nesting it keeps everything tidy.

-------------------

Imagine a car manufacturing system. A Car class might have a nested Engine class because the engine is an integral part of the car and doesn’t make sense independently. Here, Engine is tied to Car, just like in real life, reflecting a natural relationship in our code

To wrap up, nested classes are a powerful feature in Java for organizing code. We’ve got four types to cover in detail: static nested, inner, local, and anonymous classes. Stay tuned for our next lecture on static nested classes!
