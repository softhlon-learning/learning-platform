Now, we’ll look at one of Java’s most-used classes: String. Strings are how we handle text—names, messages, you name it—and understanding them is key to mastering Java. Let’s dive into what makes String special and how to use it effectively!

-------------------
-------------------

So, what is the String class? It’s Java’s way of representing text—a sequence of characters like letters or numbers. It’s in the java.lang package, so you don’t need to import it—it’s always there. A big deal about String is that it’s immutable: once you create one, like 'Hello, World!', you can’t tweak it. That sounds limiting, but it’s powerful, as we’ll see. Here’s a simple example to start.

-------------------
-------------------

How do you create a String? Two ways: First, with a literal—just write the text in quotes, like 'Hi'. Second, with the new keyword, though that’s less common. Java has a trick called the String Pool: literals like 'Java' get reused to save memory—so s1 and s2 here point to the same object. But new String("Java") forces a new object, s3. The pool makes literals efficient, which is why they’re preferred.

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s talk immutability. Once a String is made, you can’t change it—methods that seem to edit it actually create a new one. Here, s starts as 'Hello', and adding ' World' makes a new string, not altering the old one. Why’s this good? It’s thread-safe—no race conditions in multi-threading. It’s cacheable, thanks to the String Pool. And it’s secure—immutable data won’t shift under you. It’s a trade-off for simplicity and safety.

-------------------
-------------------

Now, some key String methods. length() tells you how many characters—'Java' has 4. charAt() grabs a character by index—index 1 in 'Java' is 'a' (0-based, remember). substring() slices out a piece—here, from 1 to 3 gives 'av'. These are bread-and-butter tools for working with text, and they’re easy to use once you get the hang of indexing.

-------------------
-------------------

More methods: equals() checks if two strings match content-wise—spaces matter, so ' Hello ' isn’t 'Hello'. trim() fixes that by cutting edge spaces, making them equal. toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() switch the case—here. These are super handy for cleaning up or comparing user input, where extras like spaces can sneaky in.

-------------------
-------------------

Concatenation is joining strings. The + operator is the easiest—like here, combining 'Hello' and 'World' with a space into 'Hello World'. There’s also concat(), which does the same thing method-style. Either way, because of immutability, you’re making a new string each time—not editing the old ones. + is more readable, so it’s usually the go-to.

-------------------
-------------------

Here’s a catch: using + a lot—like in a loop—creates tons of new strings, which slows things down. Enter StringBuilder, a mutable helper. You start with an empty StringBuilder, append() your pieces, and call toString() when done. Here, we build 'Hello World' with one object instead of three. It’s way faster for heavy concatenation—like building big text outputs—so keep it in your toolkit.

-------------------
-------------------

Some pitfalls to dodge: Don’t use == to compare strings—it checks object identity, not content. Here, s1 and s2 say 'Hi', but == is false because they’re different objects; equals() is true. Overusing + in loops kills performance—use StringBuilder instead. And watch for null strings—calling length() on null crashes. Tip: always use equals() for content and check for null first.

-------------------
-------------------

That’s it for our lecture! The String class is Java’s text powerhouse—immutable, versatile, and everywhere. Key takeaways: it’s made with literals or new, packed with methods like length() and equals(), and pairs with StringBuilder for speed. For next steps, try String.format() for fancy formatting or regex for text tricks. Thanks for joining me.
