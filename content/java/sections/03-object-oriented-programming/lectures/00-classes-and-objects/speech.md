Hello everyone, welcome to this lecture on Classes and Objects in Java! This time we’ll dive into the core of object-oriented programming in Java. Classes and objects are how we model real-world ideas in code, and by the end, you’ll know how to create and use them. Let’s get started!

-------------------
-------------------

So, what are classes and objects? A class is like a blueprint—it defines what something is and what it can do. An object is an instance of that class, a real thing made from the blueprint. Think of a cookie cutter as the class and each cookie it makes as an object. Java is built around this idea—object-oriented programming—where classes and objects are the foundation of nearly everything we do.

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s define a class. Here’s a Car class. You start with the class keyword, give it a name, and inside, you add fields—like color and speed—which are the attributes, and methods—like accelerate()—which are the behaviors. This class is our blueprint: it says a car has a color and speed and can accelerate. No objects yet—just the design.

-------------------
-------------------

Now, how do we create objects? We use the new keyword with the class name. Here, Car myCar = new Car() makes an object from the Car class. new allocates memory, and myCar is a reference to that object—like a remote control. We can then set its fields: myCar.color to 'Red', myCar.speed to 50. Now we’ve got a real car to work with!

-------------------
-------------------

To use an object, we access its fields and methods with the dot operator. In this main method, we create a myCar object, set its color to 'Red' and speed to 0, then call accelerate(), which bumps the speed by 10. When we print it, we get 'Red car speed: 10'. The dot ties everything together—it’s how we interact with the object’s data and actions.

-------------------
-------------------

Next up: constructors. A constructor is a special method that runs when an object is created, setting it up. Here, we add a Car constructor that takes a color and speed as parameters and assigns them to the fields. It’s got the same name as the class and no return type. Now, we can create a car like this: new Car("Blue", 20). It’s a cleaner way to initialize objects right from the start.

-------------------
-------------------

You can create multiple objects from one class, and each is independent. Here, car1 is a red car with speed 30, and car2 is a green car with speed 50. When we call accelerate() on car1, its speed goes to 40, but car2 stays at 50. They’re separate instances—same blueprint, different cookies. This is the power of classes: one design, many unique objects.

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s talk briefly about encapsulation — a big OOP idea. We hide the fields by making them private, so only the class can touch them directly. Then, we add public methods like setSpeed and getSpeed to control access. Here, the Car class keeps color and speed private, and you use these methods to interact with them. It’s like locking your valuables and handing out keys—safer and more controlled.

-------------------
-------------------

"Some pitfalls to avoid: First, forgetting new—just declaring Car myCar doesn’t create an object; it’s null until you use new. Second, null references—if you call a method on an uninitialized object, you’ll crash with a NullPointerException. Third, leaving fields public—it skips encapsulation and invites trouble. The tip: always initialize with new and stick to private fields with getters and setters."

-------------------
-------------------

That’s our lecture! Classes define the structure, and objects bring it to life. Key takeaways: classes are blueprints with fields and methods, objects are instances made with new, and constructors plus encapsulation make your code robust. For next steps, check out inheritance and polymorphism—they build on this foundation. Thanks for joining me, and I’m happy to answer questions!
