Hello everyone, welcome to this Java Networking Overview! Networking lets programs communicate over the internet or local networks, and Java makes it pretty straightforward with built-in tools. By the end, you’ll understand the basics and see how to get started. Let’s jump in!

-------------------
-------------------

What is networking in Java? It’s all about enabling communication between devices—like computers or phones—over a network, whether it’s the internet or a local setup. Java gives us powerful APIs to handle this, mainly through the java.net package. It supports key protocols like TCP/IP for reliable connections and UDP for faster, less-reliable ones. Think of it as Java’s toolkit for building chat apps, servers, or anything that talks over a network.

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s cover some key concepts. First, the client-server model: one program, the client, requests something—like a webpage—and another, the server, responds. Sockets are the endpoints that make this communication happen, like plugs connecting two sides. Every device has an IP address, a unique ID like 192.168.1.1, and ports—like 80 for web traffic—act as specific channels on that device. These are the building blocks of networking

-------------------
-------------------

Java provides several tools for networking, all in java.net. Socket is for clients connecting over TCP—think of it as the phone line. ServerSocket is what servers use to listen for incoming calls. For UDP, there’s DatagramSocket, which is lighter but less reliable—good for streaming. And for simpler web tasks, like fetching a webpage, URL and URLConnection handle the heavy lifting at a higher level. These are your main players

-------------------
-------------------

Here’s a simple TCP client example. We use a Socket to connect to a server at 'localhost'—our own machine—on port 1234. We grab the socket’s output stream with PrintWriter and send a message: 'Hello, Server!'. Then we close the socket. This is the client side of a conversation—it dials in, says something, and hangs up. Of course, it needs a server to talk to, which we’ll see next.

-------------------
-------------------

Now, the server side. We create a ServerSocket listening on port 1234. It waits with accept(), which blocks until a client connects. When one does, we get a Socket for that client and use BufferedReader to read the message—like 'Hello, Server!' from our client. We print it, then close everything. Run the server first, then the client, and you’ll see the message go through. This is a basic TCP chat!

-------------------
-------------------

For UDP, it’s a bit different. Here’s a sender: we create a DatagramSocket, pack a message into a DatagramPacket with the destination—localhost, port 1234—and send it. No connection needed! The receiver sets up a DatagramSocket on the same port, waits with receive(), and prints the message from the packet. UDP is faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery—think of it as sending a postcard instead of a registered letter.

-------------------
-------------------

For something simpler, Java’s URL class handles web requests. This example fetches the HTML from 'example.com'. We create a URL object, open its stream with openStream(), and read it line-by-line with BufferedReader. It prints the webpage content—like a mini browser! This is high-level networking: no sockets, just a ready-made way to grab web data.

-------------------
-------------------

Networking has its challenges. You’ll deal with exceptions like IOException if a connection fails or UnknownHostException if a host isn’t found. Many methods block, waiting for the network, which can slow things down. Security is another hurdle—firewalls or Java’s SecurityManager might block you. The tip: always wrap your code in try-catch blocks and test it on real networks, not just localhost.

-------------------
-------------------

That’s our overview! Java’s java.net package makes networking approachable, whether it’s TCP with Socket and ServerSocket, UDP with DatagramSocket, or web access with URL. Key takeaways: pick the right tool, handle exceptions, and manage blocking. Thanks for joining me.
