Well, finally :), It's last section in this course! Welcome to this short lecture on Java Enhancement Proposals! Today we’ll dive into how Java gets better over time through JEPs. These proposals shape the language we use, and by the end, you’ll see how they work and why they matter. Let’s jump in!

-------------------
-------------------

Java Enhancement Proposals  are a formal way to suggest and develop improvements for Java. It’s run by the OpenJDK community, the folks who maintain Java’s open-source core. The goal? Add cool new features, fix problems, and keep the JDK evolving. Think of JEPs as Java’s wishlist that actually gets built!

-------------------
-------------------

How does a JEP happen? It’s a clear process: First, someone drafts an idea. Then, the community reviews it—lots of feedback! If it’s a go, it gets a JEP number. Next, coders implement and test it. Finally, it lands in a JDK release. JEP 0 kicked this off years ago as the master index. It’s collaborative and deliberate—Java doesn’t change overnight!

-------------------
-------------------

There are a few types of JEPs. Feature JEPs bring new stuff—like records or switch expressions. Process JEPs tweak how Java’s made, like release schedules. Informational JEPs just share info, no code. Most JEPs you’ll hear about are features—new toys for us developers to play with in the JDK!

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s spotlight some big JEPs. JEP 286 in Java 10 gave us var for cleaner code. JEP 405 in Java 17 introduced records—super handy for data classes. JEP 445 in Java 21 made tiny programs simpler with unnamed classes. And JEP 454 in Java 22 brought the Foreign Function & Memory API for native code. These show how JEPs keep Java fresh and practical.

-------------------
-------------------

Why care about JEPs? They keep Java modern—competing with newer languages. It’s community-driven, so developers like us have a say. The process is transparent—check openjdk.org to follow along. And they hit home: new features from JEPs change how we write code, making it better and easier.

-------------------
-------------------

That’s it for our quick dive! JEPs drive Java’s future, one proposal at a time. Key takeaways: it’s a formal, open process that brings us features like var and records. Want more? Visit openjdk.org/jeps to see what’s cooking.
