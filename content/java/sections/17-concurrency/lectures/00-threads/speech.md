Welcome to this introduction to Java Threads! I’ll be guiding you through the basics of threads in Java. Threads are a fundamental concept for building efficient, multitasking applications, and by the end of this session, you’ll have a solid understanding of what they are and how to use them. Let’s get started!

-------------------
-------------------

So, what exactly are threads? A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Think of it as a lightweight sub-task that can run alongside other tasks in your program. By using threads, you can achieve concurrency, meaning multiple operations can happen at the same time—or at least appear to. In Java, threads are managed by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, which makes it easier for us to create and control them. This is especially useful for tasks like handling user input while processing data in the background.

-------------------
-------------------

Why should we use threads? The main reason is to improve performance by allowing parallel execution. For example, threads can make your application more responsive—imagine a GUI app where the interface doesn’t freeze while it’s performing a heavy calculation. Threads also help you take full advantage of modern multi-core processors, splitting work across cores. A simple real-world example is downloading a file in the background while simultaneously updating a progress bar for the user. Threads make this kind of multitasking possible.

-------------------
-------------------

Now, let’s look at how to create threads in Java. There are two primary ways to do this. First, you can extend the Thread class and override its run method, which defines what the thread will do. Here’s an example: we create a class MyThread, extend Thread, and print a message in the run method. The second way is to implement the Runnable interface, which also requires a run method. This approach is often preferred because it allows more flexibility, like extending another class if needed. Here’s an example of that too. Both methods get the job done, but we’ll see how to start them next.

-------------------
-------------------

Once you’ve defined a thread, how do you start it? You use the start() method. This tells the JVM to run the thread’s run method in a separate execution path. Here’s how it works: for the Thread subclass, you create an instance and call start(). For Runnable, you pass it to a Thread object’s constructor and then call start() on that. One key thing to note: if you call run() directly instead of start(), it’ll just execute in the current thread, not a new one. So always use start() to get true multithreading.

-------------------
-------------------

Threads go through different states during their lifecycle. When you create a thread, it’s in the 'New' state—ready but not yet started. Once you call start(), it moves to 'Runnable,' meaning it’s either running or waiting to run. A thread might enter 'Blocked' or 'Waiting' states if it’s paused, like waiting for a lock or another event. Finally, when the run method finishes, it’s 'Terminated' and done. This brief introduction gives a simple view of how these states connect. Understanding this helps you manage threads effectively.

-------------------
-------------------

Java provides some handy methods to control threads. For instance, sleep() pauses a thread for a specified time—like here, pausing for 1 second. join() lets one thread wait for another to finish, which is great for coordination. And setPriority() adjusts a thread’s priority, from 1 to 10, influencing which thread the JVM favors, though it’s not a guarantee. In this example, we set a thread to maximum priority and pause it briefly. These methods give you basic tools to manage how threads behave.

-------------------
-------------------

Threads aren’t without challenges. One issue is race conditions, where multiple threads access shared data unpredictably, leading to errors. Another is deadlocks, where threads get stuck waiting for each other indefinitely. To fix these, you often need synchronization—using the synchronized keyword or locks to control access. A pro tip: keep your thread logic as simple as possible to minimize these risks. Multithreading is powerful, but it requires careful design.

-------------------
-------------------

That’s it for our introduction! Threads in Java let you build concurrent, high-performance applications. To recap: you can create threads by extending Thread or implementing Runnable, launch them with start(), and control them with methods like sleep() and join(). There’s more to learn, like thread pools for managing multiple threads or advanced synchronization techniques, so I encourage you to explore those next.
