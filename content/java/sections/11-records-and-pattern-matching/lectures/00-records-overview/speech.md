_Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to look at one of the newest features in Java: Records. Introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and finalized in Java 16, records aim to simplify the creation of classes that are essentially data carriers.

So, what are Java Records?

Records are a special kind of class designed for storing immutable data. They offer a more concise syntax for defining classes where the primary purpose is to hold data, reducing boilerplate code significantly.

Let's discuss key features of Records.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Declaration.

-------------------

Records are declared using the record keyword instead of class. Here, Person is a record with two components: name and age.

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Immutability.

-------------------

By default, records in Java are immutable, meaning that after you instantiate a record, you cannot modify its state or values

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Automatic Generation of Methods.

-------------------

Java records come with several methods automatically generated by the compiler to provide basic functionality:
- to String method, which provides a string representation of the record (includes the class name followed by the names and values of all the components).
- equals() and hashCode() methods.
- accessor Methods (getters, sort of).

-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Compact Constructors.

-------------------

If you require custom initialization logic, you can include a compact constructor directly in the record declaration.
The if statement checks if age is less than 0. If it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message indicating that age cannot be negative. This ensures that age is always non-negative when a Person record is instantiated.


-------------------
-------------------
-------------------

Canonical Constructor.

-------------------

Each record automatically includes a constructor, known as the canonical constructor, which corresponds exactly to its components in the order they are declared.
Here is the example.

-------------------

In conclusion, Java records provide a clean, efficient way to define classes that are primarily data holders, promoting better object-oriented design practices with less boilerplate. They're particularly useful in scenarios where you're dealing with domain models, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), or any scenario where immutable data structures are beneficial. Thank you for your attention, and let's explore how we can integrate records into our Java projects._
