"Hi, welcome to this lecture on Error Handling in Java! Let's look on how Java deals with errors—those pesky things that can crash your programs. By the end, you’ll know how to catch, handle, and even throw errors like a pro. Let’s get started and tame those bugs!"

-------------------
-------------------

So, what are errors in Java? They’re unexpected issues that pop up when your program runs—like a file disappearing or memory running out. Java splits them into two camps: Exceptions, which you can often fix, like 'file not found,' and Errors, which are usually game-over, like OutOfMemoryError. Both live in java.lang, and today we’ll focus on exceptions—those we can handle and recover from.

-------------------
-------------------

Here’s the family tree. At the top is Throwable, the parent of everything. It splits into Error for system crashes—like running out of stack space—and Exception for program issues. Exception has two kids: RuntimeException, unchecked ones like NullPointerException that you don’t have to declare, and checked exceptions like IOException that you must handle. This hierarchy guides how we catch and manage them.

-------------------
-------------------

Let’s meet the stars: try and catch. Put risky code in a try block—like dividing by zero, which throws an ArithmeticException. If it fails, the catch block grabs the exception—in this case, an ArithmeticException—and handles it. Here, we print the error message, '/ by zero'. Without this, the program would crash. try-catch keeps it running smoothly.

-------------------
-------------------

What if multiple things can go wrong? Use multiple catch blocks. Here, we try to get the length of a null string—boom, NullPointerException—then access an invalid array index—ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Each catch handles one type: null errors or array errors. Order matters—put specific exceptions first, like these, before a general one, or the compiler will complain.

-------------------
-------------------

Then there’s finally. This block runs whether the try succeeds or fails—great for cleanup, like closing files. In this example, we throw an exception in try, catch it, and print its message. finally runs last, saying 'Cleanup done.' It’s like the janitor who sweeps up no matter how the party ends. You can skip it, but it’s clutch for resource management.

-------------------
-------------------

Sometimes, you want to throw your own exceptions. Use throw to raise one—like here, if age is negative, we throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message. The method declares it with throws, warning callers they need to handle it. It’s like tossing a hot potato—'Hey, deal with this!'—and it’s how you enforce rules in your code.

-------------------
-------------------

For resources like files, try-with-resources is a gem. Put an object that implements AutoCloseable—like FileReader—in parentheses, and it closes automatically when done. Here, we read from a file, and if it fails, we catch the IOException. No finally needed—the JVM handles cleanup. It’s cleaner and safer, cutting boilerplate for stuff like streams or sockets.

-------------------
-------------------

Some best practices: Catch specific exceptions before general ones—don’t just grab Exception first. Never swallow exceptions—leaving catch empty hides problems. At least log them—like with printStackTrace()—so you know what’s up. For app-specific rules, create custom exceptions. And a tip: test your error paths, not just the happy ones. Good error handling makes robust code.

"That’s our lecture! Error handling keeps your Java programs from crashing and burning. Key takeaways: try-catch handles exceptions, finally cleans up, and throw/throws lets you signal issues. Try-with-resources simplifies resource management. Thanks for listening.
